                        <h2> Credit Card Fraud Detection </h2>
                        <p> Credit card fraud is a major issue for financial institutions and customers alike, as it can result 
                            in significant financial losses. Machine learning algorithms have been widely employed to 
                            detect fraudulent transactions in credit card transactions. The primary purpose is to detect fraud by filtering the 
                            aforementioned strategies to achieve a better outcome </p>

                            <h2> Motion Detection </h2>
                            <p> Motion detection cameras, lights, and sensors used in home security systems generally rely on PIR sensors.
                                These detect infrared energy, which humans and animals release as heat. If the motion sensor detects an increase 
                                in infrared energy, meaning someone has approached the sensor or walked within its range, it notifies the home security control panel and an alarm sounds. </p>
